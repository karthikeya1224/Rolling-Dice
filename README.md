This was my mini project done by me while learning java script. Here, in this project I used HTML,CSS,JS.
HTML- In this everything is normal but the main thing used here was dice emoji we can get that by windows and . symbols.
CSS- In the css I gave styling to the button and gave styling to the dice by using 'transition'.
JS- In this I used math objects and switch operator and styling too.
